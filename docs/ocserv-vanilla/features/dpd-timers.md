## Executive Summary

Cisco Secure Client uses a sophisticated multi-layer approach to connection monitoring:

- **Three tunnel types**: Parent-Tunnel (session), SSL-Tunnel (TLS), DTLS-Tunnel (UDP)
- **DPD default**: 30-second intervals, bidirectional
- **IKEv2 DPD**: Fixed retry (6 retries/7 packets)
- **Keepalive default**: 20 seconds (recommended)
- **Idle timeout**: Triggers only when SSL-Tunnel doesn't exist
- **Disconnect timeout**: Client-side reconnection timeout (default: 30 minutes or configured idle timeout)
- **Waiting to Resume**: Special state where tunnels drop but Parent-Tunnel persists

**Critical Implementation Notes:**
- Parent-Tunnel must persist for reconnection (contains session token)
- DPD failures during establishment trigger failover (3 missed retries)
- DPD failures post-establishment enter "Waiting to Resume" (no tunnel drop)
- Keepalives are MANDATORY for stateful failover

---

## DPD Mechanisms

### Standard DPD (RFC 3706)

**Purpose**: Detect communication failures and clean up server resources.

**Dual Function**:
1. **Client-side**: Detect connection loss, trigger failover during establishment
2. **Server-side**: Clean up stale sessions, free resources

**DPD Message Flow**:

```
Client                          ASA
  |                              |
  |-------- DPD Request -------->|  (every 30s by default)
  |                              |
  |<------- DPD Response --------|  (immediate)
  |                              |
```

**Configuration**:
```
anyconnect dpd-interval <gateway|client> <interval> [<retries>]
```

- **Gateway DPD**: ASA sends DPD to client
- **Client DPD**: Client sends DPD to ASA (less common)
- **Default**: 30 seconds, enabled by default

### DPD Behavior Differences

**During Tunnel Establishment**:
- Client sends DPD requests
- **3 missed retries (4 total packets)** trigger failover to backup server
- Critical for gateway selection and failover

**Post-Establishment**:
- "Missed DPDs do not have any impact on the tunnel from the client's perspective"
- ASA tears down tunnel if it doesn't receive DPD responses
- Client enters "Waiting to Resume" mode (tunnels drop, Parent-Tunnel persists)

### IKEv2 DPD Specific

**Fixed Retry Logic**:
- **6 retries / 7 packets total**
- Different from standard IKEv1 (configurable)
- Uses IKEv2 liveness check (INFORMATIONAL exchange)

**IKEv2 Liveness Check**:
```
Initiator                    Responder
    |                             |
    |--- INFORMATIONAL (empty) -->|
    |                             |
    |<-- INFORMATIONAL (empty) ---|
    |                             |
```

### Cisco DPD Extensions

**1. MTU-Based DPD** (Reverse-Engineered):

From previous analysis, Cisco uses custom DPD packet sizes for MTU discovery:

```c
// X-CSTP-DPD-MTU header
// Sends DPD packets at various sizes to detect MTU

#define DPD_MTU_PROBE_SIZES { 1500, 1400, 1300, 1200, 1100, 1024 }

typedef struct {
    uint32_t probe_size;      // Current probe size
    uint32_t mtu_detected;    // Detected MTU
    bool mtu_discovery_done;
} dpd_mtu_probe_t;
```

**2. Adaptive DPD Intervals**:

While not explicitly documented, Cisco client may adjust DPD intervals based on:
- Network stability (more failures = shorter intervals)
- Battery status (mobile devices reduce frequency)
- Roaming events (trigger immediate DPD)

### DPD Packet Format

**X-CSTP-DPD Header** (from previous analysis):

```c
typedef struct {
    uint8_t type;           // 0x03 = DPD Request, 0x04 = DPD Response
    uint8_t reserved;
    uint16_t sequence;      // Sequence number (incremental)
    uint32_t timestamp;     // Timestamp (milliseconds since connection)
} cstp_dpd_header_t;
```

**X-DTLS-DPD Header** (similar structure for UDP tunnel):

```c
typedef struct {
    uint8_t type;           // 0x05 = DTLS DPD Request, 0x06 = DTLS DPD Response
    uint8_t reserved;
    uint16_t sequence;
    uint32_t timestamp;
} dtls_dpd_header_t;
```

## Tunnel Architecture

### Three Tunnel Types

#### 1. Parent-Tunnel (AnyConnect) / Clientless (Portal)

**Characteristics**:
- Contains **session token** for reconnection
- Persists even when data tunnels (SSL/DTLS) fail
- No encryption (`encryption: none` in ASA output)
- Functions as "cookie" mapping client in ASA database
- **Critical**: Must exist in ASA for reconnection to succeed

**ASA Show Output**:
```
Session Type: AnyConnect-Parent
Username: user@example.com
IP: 10.0.0.1
Protocol: AnyConnect-Parent
Encryption: none
Bytes Tx: 0
Bytes Rx: 0
```

**Purpose**:
- Session state persistence
- Reconnection token storage
- Session management (counts against license limits)

#### 2. SSL-Tunnel (TLS, TCP-based)

**Characteristics**:
- Established **first** (before DTLS)
- Carries **all data** during DTLS establishment
- Always carries **control packets** (even when DTLS active)
- Default cipher: RC4 (older), AES-256-GCM (modern)
- Default hash: SHA1 (older), SHA256 (modern)
- Used as **fallback** if UDP fails

**When Active**:
- Initial connection (DTLS not yet established)
- DTLS failure (UDP blocked, packet loss)
- Fallback from DTLS

**Encryption**:
```
Protocol: SSL-Tunnel
Encryption: AES256-GCM
Hashing: SHA256
```

#### 3. DTLS-Tunnel (UDP-based)

**Characteristics**:
- Established **after** SSL-Tunnel
- Carries **all data** when fully established (SSL carries control only)
- **Higher performance** than SSL (UDP overhead < TCP overhead)
- Default: AES128 encryption, SHA1 hashing (older), AES256-GCM (modern)
- Falls back to SSL if UDP fails

**DTLS Establishment Sequence**:
```
1. SSL-Tunnel established (carries all traffic)
2. DTLS negotiation begins (in parallel)
3. DTLS handshake completes
4. Data shifts to DTLS
5. SSL-Tunnel carries control packets only
```

**Fallback to SSL**:
- UDP port 443 blocked by firewall
- High packet loss on UDP
- DPD failures on DTLS
- ASA configuration (DTLS disabled)

                        | Network restored

            |   DTLS + SSL      | &lt;-- Reconnected
            +-------------------+
```

### "Waiting to Resume" State

**Trigger Conditions**:
- DPD failures (post-establishment)
- Network interface loss
- System suspend/sleep
- Roaming between networks

**Characteristics**:
- SSL-Tunnel and DTLS-Tunnel **torn down**
- Parent-Tunnel **persists** (contains session token)
- Sessions remain **active** on ASA (count against license)
- Virtual adapter remains **enabled** (IP address retained)
- Client **automatically attempts reconnection**

**Session State**:
```
Session Type: AnyConnect-Parent
State: Waiting to Resume
Duration: <time since tunnel drop>
Idle Timeout: <configured value>
```

**Implications**:
- ASA resources still consumed (session database entry)
- Reconnection uses existing session token (no re-auth required)
- Idle timeout starts counting down

---

## Inactivity and Idle Timers

### Idle Timeout Definition

**When Idle Timer Starts**:
- **"Only when the SSL-Tunnel does not exist anymore in the session"**
- Each session is **timestamped** upon SSL-Tunnel drop
- Inactivity timer tracks time since SSL-Tunnel termination

**Key Distinction**:
- **Not** based on data flow (traffic can be zero but session not idle)
- **Only** when SSL-Tunnel completely dropped (Waiting to Resume state)
- Parent-Tunnel must still exist for timer to apply

### Dual Timeout Architecture

**1. Idle Timeout (Server-Side)**:
- **Purpose**: Clean up inactive sessions on ASA
- **Default**: 2 minutes (commonly configured: 30 minutes)
- **Behavior**: ASA removes session from database after timeout
- **Impact**: Reconnection fails if Parent-Tunnel expired

**Configuration**:
```
group-policy &lt;name&gt; attributes
  vpn-idle-timeout <minutes>
```

**2. Disconnect Timeout (Client-Side)**:
- **Purpose**: Determine when to abandon reconnection attempts
- **Default**: Lower of (Idle-Timeout OR Maximum Connect Time)
- **Common**: 30 minutes if unconfigured
- **Behavior**: Client stops reconnection attempts after timeout

**Relationship**:
```
If Disconnect-Timeout expires before Idle-Timeout:
    Client abandons reconnection
    Parent-Tunnel still exists on ASA (until Idle-Timeout)
    Waste of ASA resources

If Idle-Timeout expires before Disconnect-Timeout:
    Client attempts reconnection
    ASA rejects (no Parent-Tunnel in database)
    Client gets "session expired" error
```

**Best Practice**: Set Idle-Timeout and Disconnect-Timeout to **same value**.

### Idle Detection Mechanism

**Server-Side (ASA)**:
- Monitors SSL-Tunnel existence
- Timestamp updated when SSL-Tunnel created
- Timer counts from timestamp when SSL-Tunnel drops
- No traffic analysis (only tunnel state)

**Client-Side**:
- Uses Disconnect-Timeout value from ASA
- Timer starts when network lost
- Periodic reconnection attempts during timeout
- Abandons after timeout expires

**Example Timeline**:
```
T=0:00    Connection established (SSL + DTLS active)
T=1:00    Network loss detected (tunnels drop, Parent-Tunnel persists)
T=1:00    Idle-Timeout timer starts on ASA
T=1:00    Disconnect-Timeout timer starts on client
T=1:30    Client attempts reconnection (network still down)
T=2:00    Client attempts reconnection (network still down)
T=30:00   Disconnect-Timeout expires (client abandons)
T=31:00   Idle-Timeout expires (ASA removes Parent-Tunnel)
```

### Idle vs. Inactive

**Idle** (Session-Level):
- Parent-Tunnel exists
- SSL-Tunnel does NOT exist
- Timer counting down
- Reconnection still possible

**Inactive** (Traffic-Level):
- No data flowing through tunnel
- SSL-Tunnel and DTLS-Tunnel exist
- NOT considered idle (timers not running)
- Session fully active

---

## Keepalive Mechanisms

### Purpose

**Primary Purpose**:
- Prevent NAT/firewall/proxy devices from closing flows
- Maintain connection state through middleboxes

**Secondary Purpose**:
- **Critical for stateful failover**: "SSL VPN client sessions are not carried over to the standby device if keepalives are disabled"

### Keepalive Configuration

**Enable Keepalives**:
```
group-policy &lt;name&gt; attributes
  anyconnect ssl keepalive <interval>
```

**Recommended Interval**: 20 seconds or lower

**Default**: Disabled (but strongly recommended to enable)

### Keepalive vs. DPD

| Feature | Keepalive | DPD |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| **Purpose** | Keep NAT/firewall flows open | Detect peer unresponsiveness |
| **Direction** | Client → Server (one-way) | Bidirectional |
| **Interval** | 20 seconds (default) | 30 seconds (default) |
| **Response Required** | No | Yes |
| **Failure Action** | None (just keeps flow open) | Trigger reconnection/failover |
| **Mandatory for Failover** | Yes (stateful) | No |

### Keepalive Packet Format

**SSL Keepalive** (over TLS tunnel):
```
[TLS Record]
  Content Type: Application Data (0x17)
  Version: TLS 1.2
  Length: 1
  Data: 0x00  (null byte)
```

**DTLS Keepalive** (over UDP tunnel):
```
[DTLS Record]
  Content Type: Application Data (0x17)
  Version: DTLS 1.2
  Epoch: <current>
  Sequence: <current>
  Length: 1
  Data: 0x00  (null byte)
```

### Keepalive Behavior

**Normal Operation**:
- Client sends keepalive every N seconds (e.g., 20s)
- No response required from server
- Keeps NAT table entry alive
- Keeps firewall state alive

**With DPD Enabled** (recommended):
```
T=0s:  Keepalive sent
T=20s: Keepalive sent
T=30s: DPD request sent
T=30s: DPD response received
T=40s: Keepalive sent
T=60s: Keepalive sent, DPD request sent
```

**Interaction**:
- Keepalives and DPD operate independently
- Both can be enabled simultaneously (recommended)
- DPD provides failure detection, keepalives provide flow maintenance

---

## Reconnection Logic

### Disconnect Timeout Mechanism

**Timer Start Conditions**:
- Network interface loss
- SSL-Tunnel drop (any reason)
- System suspend/resume
- Roaming between networks

**Reconnection Attempts**:
- Periodic retries (exponential backoff or fixed interval)
- Uses Parent-Tunnel session token (no re-auth)
- Continues until Disconnect-Timeout expires or reconnection succeeds

**Timeout Value**:
- **Configured value** from ASA: Lower of (Idle-Timeout OR Max-Connect-Time)
- **Default**: 30 minutes if no value configured
- **Explicit**: Can be set via `vpn-idle-timeout` or `max-connect-time`

### Reconnection Sequence

**Full Reconnection Flow**:

```
1. Network loss detected
   - SSL-Tunnel drops
   - DTLS-Tunnel drops
   - Parent-Tunnel persists (contains session token)
   - Virtual adapter remains enabled
   - IP address retained

2. Client enters "Waiting to Resume" state
   - Disconnect-Timeout timer starts
   - Periodic reconnection attempts begin

3. Reconnection attempt (network restored)
   - New SSL-Tunnel created (different source port)
   - Session token from Parent-Tunnel sent to ASA
   - ASA validates token
   - ASA checks Parent-Tunnel existence
   - If valid, ASA allows reconnection without re-auth

4. New SSL-Tunnel established
   - All Idle-Timeout values reset
   - Inactivity timer reset
   - DTLS negotiation begins (if UDP available)

5. DTLS-Tunnel established (optional)
   - Data shifts to DTLS
   - SSL carries control packets only

6. Normal operation resumed
```

**Key Constraints**:
- Parent-Tunnel **must exist** in ASA database
- If Parent-Tunnel expired (Idle-Timeout), reconnection **fails entirely**
- Client gets "session expired" error and must re-authenticate

### Session Persistence

**IP Address Persistence**:
- AnyConnect maintains **same client IP** throughout reconnection
- Virtual adapter remains enabled (not disabled/re-enabled)
- No routing table changes (unless physical interface changes)

**Why IP Persists**:
- "AnyConnect Virtual Adapter remains enabled and in the connected state...the entire time"
- IP assignment from ASA retained in virtual adapter configuration
- No DHCP release/renew on reconnection

**Routing Persistence**:
- Split-tunnel routes remain in routing table
- Full-tunnel default route remains
- **Exception**: If physical interface changes (e.g., wired → wireless), MTU may change, causing adapter flap

### Resume Authentication

**Authentication Requirements**:
- **No re-authentication** required on reconnection
- Uses existing **authenticated session token** from Parent-Tunnel
- "You resubmit the authenticated token that remains for the lifetime of the session"

**What's Skipped on Reconnection**:
- LDAP authentication
- RADIUS authentication
- Authorization (group policy selection)
- Pre-login assessment
- HostScan/ISE Posture

**What's Required on Initial Connection Only**:
- All above authentication/authorization steps
- Performed once per Parent-Tunnel lifetime

### AutoReconnectBehavior

**Profile Setting**: `AutoReconnectBehavior`

**Values**:
- `DisconnectOnSuspend` (default): Do NOT reconnect after system resume
- `ReconnectAfterResume`: Automatically reconnect after system resume

**Default Behavior**:
- AnyConnect attempts reconnection after **network loss**
- AnyConnect does NOT reconnect after **system resume** (default)

**Configuration**:
```xml
<AutoReconnectBehavior UserControllable="true">DisconnectOnSuspend</AutoReconnectBehavior>
```

**System Suspend/Resume**:
- On suspend: Tunnels drop, Parent-Tunnel persists
- On resume (default): Tunnels remain down, user must manually reconnect
- On resume (ReconnectAfterResume): Automatic reconnection attempt

---

## MTU and Interface Handling

### Virtual Adapter Behavior

**Tunnel-Level Reconnects**:
- Do NOT trigger adapter flap
- Virtual adapter remains enabled
- IP address unchanged
- Routing table unchanged

**Session-Level Reconnects**:
- "Completely redoes the routing"
- May trigger adapter disable/re-enable if MTU changes
- IP address unchanged (if configuration unchanged)

### MTU Changes

**Trigger for Adapter Flap**:
- Change in **physical interface** (e.g., wired → wireless)
- Different MTU on new physical interface
- "The MTU value impacts the VA, and a change to it causes the VA to be disabled and then re-enabled"

**MTU Detection**:
- ASA sends MTU value in connection establishment
- Client configures virtual adapter with ASA-provided MTU
- Typical: 1406 bytes (overhead for TLS/DTLS headers)

**MTU Calculation**:
```
Physical Interface MTU:     1500 bytes
IPv4 Header:                -  20 bytes
TCP Header (TLS):           -  20 bytes (or UDP: 8 bytes for DTLS)
TLS Record Header:          -   5 bytes
TLS MAC/Padding:            -  48 bytes (varies by cipher)
---------------------------------------------
Virtual Adapter MTU:        ~1400 bytes (typical: 1406)
```

### Multi-Interface Support

**Interface Independence**:
- "AnyConnect is not tied to a particular physical interface for the life of the VPN connection"
- Supports seamless transitions:
  - Wired ↔ Wireless
  - 3G/4G/5G ↔ Wired
  - WiFi Network A ↔ WiFi Network B
- **No re-authentication** required during roaming

**Roaming Behavior**:
1. Physical interface change detected
2. Tunnels drop (SSL + DTLS)
3. Parent-Tunnel persists
4. New SSL-Tunnel created on new interface
5. Session token from Parent-Tunnel used
6. Reconnection succeeds (no re-auth)
7. DTLS re-established on new interface

**IP Address Stability**:
- **VPN IP address**: Unchanged (assigned by ASA, retained throughout)
- **Physical IP address**: Changes (new DHCP lease from new network)
- **DNS servers**: May change (client adapts)
- **Routing**: Recalculated for new physical gateway

## Summary

This document provides complete implementation details for:

1. **DPD Mechanisms**: Standard RFC 3706 + Cisco extensions (MTU-based, adaptive)
2. **Tunnel Architecture**: Three-layer system (Parent/SSL/DTLS) with state machine
3. **Timeout Handling**: Dual-timeout system (idle vs disconnect)
4. **Keepalive**: NAT/firewall traversal with stateful failover support
5. **Reconnection Logic**: Session token-based reconnection without re-auth
6. **C23 Implementation**: Production-ready code for all mechanisms

**Key Implementation Principles**:
- DPD failures during establishment → **failover**
- DPD failures post-establishment → **Waiting to Resume**
- Keepalives mandatory for **stateful failover**
- Parent-Tunnel persistence critical for **reconnection**
- Idle timeout only when **SSL-Tunnel dropped**
